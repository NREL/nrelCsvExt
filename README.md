Build
-----

Build instructions:

1. Create a local clone of this repository on a computer with a working copy of SkySpark.
2. From the command line, change directory to the SkySpark root directory.
3. Execute `bin/fan /path/to/nrelCsvExt/build.fan`.
   - On Linux, you may need to `chmod +x bin/fan` first.
   - Output pod will be `lib/fan/nrelCsvExt.pod` (relative to SkySpark root).
4. Execute `bin/fan docgen` to regenerate documentation.

Build instructions are the same for Windows except paths use backslashes `\` and `fan` becomes
`fan.bat`.

Note that all dependencies need to be in `lib/fan` (relative to SkySpark root); the build script
will not find pods located in `var/lib/fan`.
   
Installation
------------

Select a set of installation instructions below that corresponds to how you
obtained the **nrelCsvExt** extension. Following installation, you must enable
the *nrelCsv* extension in the *Exts* tab of the SkySpark *Settings* app within
each project that needs access to the functions.

### From Source ###

If you built from source, all that is needed to install the extension is to
start (or restart) SkySpark.

### From GitHub ###

*This package is not yet available on Github.com; currently on NREL internal Github only*

1. Download a `nrelCsvExt.pod` release from GitHub.
2. Copy `nrelCsvExt.pod` into the `lib/fan/` directory of your SkySpark
   installation.
3. Set ownership permissions correctly on the pod to match the other pods in
   your SkySpark installation (Linux/Mac).
4. From the command line, change directory to the SkySpark root directory.
5. Execute `bin/fan docgen` to regenerate documentation.
   - Optional; the functions will work without this step but the *Doc* app
     won't show any function documentation.
   - On Linux, you may need to `chmod +x bin/fan` first.
6. Start (or restart) SkySpark.

Help
----

Function documentation is available in the SkySpark *Doc* app under *nrelCsv* or
within the *Docs* interface in the *Code* app.
